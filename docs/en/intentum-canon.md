# The Intentum Canon

**Why you're reading this page** — This page gives **ten short rules** (the Canon) for intent-driven design and development: how to think and what to prioritize. The Manifesto explains "why and what"; the Canon summarizes "how". Use it as a daily reference.

**Relationship to the Manifesto:** [The Intentum Manifesto](manifesto.md) states **eight principles** (the why and what). The Canon gives **ten short rules** for intent-driven design and development (the how). Same philosophy, two formulations: Manifesto = narrative, Canon = summary.

Ten principles for Intent-Driven Development:

---

## I. Intent precedes behavior.

Behavior is observable.
Intent is inferred.

We reason about systems by intent, not by events.

---

## II. Events are signals, not truth.

An event means nothing in isolation.

Meaning emerges only when signals are interpreted together.

---

## III. Scenarios describe paths. Intent describes direction.

Paths are fragile.
Direction is resilient.

We test direction.

---

## IV. Correctness is a distribution, not a boolean.

In intelligent systems, there is no absolute "pass" or "fail".

There is only confidence.

---

## V. Confidence is a decision input, not a verdict.

High confidence can still be wrong.
Low confidence can still be acceptable.

Confidence informs judgment, not replaces it.

---

## VI. Intent is independent of implementation.

Flows change.
Models change.
Vendors change.

Intent remains.

---

## VII. Failure is information.

Retries, deviations, and anomalies are signals.

A system that cannot learn from failure cannot reason.

---

## VIII. AI produces signals. Intent produces meaning.

AI assists inference.
It does not define truth.

Intent is a human responsibility.

---

## IX. We design for understanding, not control.

Control assumes determinism.
Understanding accepts uncertainty.

Modern systems require the latter.

---

## X. Intent is the contract of the AI era.

APIs expose functions.
Systems expose behavior.
Intent defines expectation.

---

## Closing line

> If behavior is what happened,  
> intent is what mattered.
