# Why Intentum?

The name Intentum is not accidental. It carries a deliberate philosophy that aligns with the framework's design.

---

## Latin root: Intentio → Intentum

- **Intentio:** intention, direction, aim
- **Intentum:** the thing aimed at; the intended outcome; the conscious goal

So:

- Intentum ≠ "What was done?"
- Intentum = "What was being aimed at?"

This matches the framework's focus: we care about *direction*, not just events.

---

## A deliberate break from classical software

Classically, systems are read through:

- Event
- Action
- State
- Scenario

The name Intentum asserts:

**In this era, systems must understand intent, not just behavior.**

- BDD → behavior
- DDD → domain
- TDD → verification
- **Intentum → direction**

That is a clear stance.

## Why the "-um" suffix matters

In Latin, the *-um* suffix denotes:

- a concretized concept
- the objectified form of something

So:

- **Intent** → abstract
- **Intentum** → measurable, decidable, processable

That is why names like **Intentum.Core**, **Intentum.Runtime**, **Intentum.Policy** feel natural.

## Why the name fits the AI era

For AI systems:

- There is no certainty
- There is probability
- There is distribution
- There is uncertainty

In this world we no longer ask:

"Is this correct?"

We ask:

"Is this consistent with the intent?"

Intentum fills that gap:

- confidence
- signal
- behavior space
- decision

The name describes the technical design in advance.

## One-line definition 

**Intentum is a framework for understanding what systems and users were trying to achieve — not just what they did.**

Or more sharply:

**Software should be judged by intent, not by events.**
