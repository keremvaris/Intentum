# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Intentum, please report it responsibly.

- **Preferred:** Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/keremvaris/Intentum/security/advisories/new) (private by default). This allows the maintainers to discuss and fix the issue before it is disclosed.
- **Alternative:** Contact the repository maintainers directly (e.g. via the contact information on their GitHub profile) with a clear description of the issue and steps to reproduce.

Please do **not** open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

## What to expect

- We will acknowledge your report and work with you to understand and address the issue.
- We may ask for more details or clarification.
- Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate disclosure (e.g. release notes, CVE if applicable) and credit you if you wish.

## Scope

This project includes library and sample code. Vulnerabilities in dependencies should be reported to the respective upstream projects; we still appreciate a heads-up so we can update dependencies and document mitigations.

Thank you for helping keep Intentum and its users safe.
